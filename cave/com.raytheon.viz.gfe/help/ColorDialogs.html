Color Chooser and Color Table Editor Dialogs</h1>
The <a href="#ColorChooser">color chooser</a> and <a
 href="#ColorTableEditor">color
table editor</a> dialogs are used to define custom colors and color
tables
for the GFE.
<p></p>
<hr width="100%">
<h2><a name="ColorDialog"></a><a name="ColorChooser"></a>Color Chooser
Dialog</h2>
<p><br>
The Color Chooser Dialog is involked from the GFE when you depress
MB3 over&nbsp; the&nbsp; graphic contour label in the spatial editor.
When
you MB3 graphic contour label,&nbsp; select the following sequence from
the pop-up menus: 'Change Graphic Color to' -&gt; 'Choose Color' .<b><font

<p><br>
The Color Chooser Dialog&nbsp; can be used to change a&nbsp;
single-colored
graphical feature (i.e., a contour).
</p>
<p>The Color Chooser Dialog consists of Hue, Saturation and Brightness
slider bars, a color wheel, a color swatch to indicate the old or
current
color, a color swatch to reflect the selected color , an "OK" button
and
a "Cancel" button.&nbsp; The 'OLD' color swatch indicates the current
contour
color until the 'OK' or 'Cancel' button is selected.
</p>
<p>If you MB1 over the color wheel to the desired color , the circle
marker
is updated to the cursor location.&nbsp; The selected color is echoed
in
the 'NEW' color swatch and the Hue, Saturation and Brightness sliders
move
to the appropriate values corresponding to your selected color.&nbsp;
If
you want to change your graphical-feature, aka contour, to the new
color,
select the 'OK' button.&nbsp; Otherwise the 'Cancel' button dismisses
the
Color Chooser without change to your graphical contour.
</p>
<p>A new color can also be selected using the Hue, Saturation or
Brightness
sliders.
</p>
<p>The various components of the ColorChooser are shown in the
following
table:

<h2><a name="ColorTableEditorDialog"></a><a name="ColorTableEditor"></a>ColorTableEditorDialog</h2>
The ColorTableEditor Dialog is involked from the GFE when you MB3 over
the 'E' toolbar button, color bar spectrum or an image label. If you
MB3
over the 'E' toolbar button, select the following sequence from the
pop-up
menus: 'PickUp Value...'-&gt;MB3 on the vertical spectrum-&gt; 'Edit
Color Table...'.&nbsp;
If you MB3 over the color bar spectrum or an image label, select the
following
sequence from the pop-up menus: 'Change Color Table to'-&gt;'Edit Color
Table'.
<p>The ColorTableEditor is used for Scalar and Vector data types.&nbsp;
There is no editor currently available for the Weather data type; the
Weather
data type is configured through the <a href="gfeConfig_WECol.html">gfe
configuration file weather color table definitions</a>.&nbsp; The
ColorTableEditor
for Discrete data types use the same data source as Scalar/Vector, but
its operations are different.&nbsp; Generally it is a good idea to
separate
out color tables for Scalar and Vector, from color tables for Discrete.

The Color Table Editor Dialog can be used to create a new color
spectrum
for a multi-colored graphical feature (i.e., an image).
<p>The Color Table Editor contains a <a href="#ColorChooser">Color
Chooser</a>&nbsp;
(without the color swatch area labeled 'OLD').&nbsp; A color spectrum
appears
in the middle section of the dialog.&nbsp; The text label contains the
selected weather product name and units.&nbsp; The left and right
triangular
pointers are labeled with minimum and maximum numerical values
corresponding
to the weather product.&nbsp; Entry labels are located on either side
of
the spectrum.&nbsp; The current left and right pointer values are
echoed
in the entry fields.&nbsp; The '&gt;&gt;' and '&lt;&lt;' buttons enable
the user
to move the pointers in an increment defined by the two entry
fields.&nbsp;
The bottom half of the dialog contains several buttons that control the
operations performed on the spectrum:&nbsp; 'Fill', 'RGB Interpolate',
'HSB Interpolate', 'Fade -&gt;', 'Dim -&gt;', '&lt;- Fade', '&lt;-Dim',
'Undo',
'Revert', 'Apply', 'Save...', 'Delete...' and 'Dismiss' buttons.
</p>
<p>After a color is selected using MB2 (i.e., MB2 somewhere within the
spectrum) or the&nbsp; <a href="#ColorChooser">Color Chooser</a>
,&nbsp;
it is reflected&nbsp; in the rectangular color swatch.&nbsp; To modify
the spectrum with the selected color,&nbsp; MB1 over either the left or
right pointer.&nbsp; The triangular area will assume the color of the
color
swatch.&nbsp; With the MB1, the left or right pointer can be moved to
the
desired weather product value.

  <p>11.&nbsp; MB1 on the right pointer.&nbsp; The right pointer will
now

</blockquote>
After completing&nbsp; Exercise 1<i>,&nbsp;</i>&nbsp; you can modify
the
selected portion of the spectrum (eq., area between 40 and 90 degrees
Fahrenheit)
with the buttons located on the bottom half of the dialog: 'Fill', 'RGB
Interpolate', 'HSB Interpolate', 'Fade -&gt;', 'Dim -&gt;', '&lt;-
Fade', '&lt;-Dim',
'Undo', 'Revert', 'Apply', 'Save...', 'Delete...' or 'Dismiss'.
<p>The various controls are described in the following table:

      <p>The 'HSB Interpolate' will 'linearly' interpolate along the
shortest
angle of the colorwheel indicated by the colors of the pointers.&nbsp;

<h3>
Discrete Color Table Editing</h3>

</center>
The Discrete Color Table Editor Dialog can be used to create a new
color
spectrum for a multi-colored graphical feature (i.e., an image).
<p>The Discrete ColorTable Editor contains a <a href="#ColorChooser">Color
Chooser</a>&nbsp; (without the color swatch area labeled 'OLD').&nbsp;
A color spectrum appears in the middle section of the dialog.&nbsp; The
text label contains the selected weather product name and units.&nbsp;
Many of the buttons on the Color Table Editor for Scalar/Vector are not
available on the Discrete Color Table Editor. The controls that are
available
include:&nbsp;'Undo', 'Revert', 'Apply', 'Save...', 'Delete...' and
'Dismiss'
buttons.
</p>
<p>After a color is selected using MB2 click (i.e., MB2 somewhere
within
the spectrum) or the&nbsp; <a href="#ColorChooser">Color Chooser</a>
,&nbsp;
it is reflected&nbsp; in the rectangular color swatch.&nbsp; To modify
the spectrum with the selected color,&nbsp; MB1 click over the desired
discrete key. When you move the mouse over a "block" in the spectrum,
the value of that "block", i.e., the discrete key, will be
displayed.&nbsp; <br>
</p>
<p>Note that Discrete color tables and Scalar color tables should not
be shared.&nbsp; Discrete color tables that are saved to the ifpServer
contain exactly the same number of entries as the possible entries in
the defined Discrete key.&nbsp; For example, the KeyTest element in the
picture above contains exactly 3 colors.&nbsp; If you reuse that color
spectrum for a scalar/vector weather element, then there will only be
three colors in that color table.<br>
</p>
<p>If a discrete color table has
been saved to disk, then the definition for the discrete weather
element is expanded, then the new entries will be assigned to "black"
until the color table editor is used to define these colors.&nbsp; The
original colors for the original set of discrete keys will remain
assigned. <br>
