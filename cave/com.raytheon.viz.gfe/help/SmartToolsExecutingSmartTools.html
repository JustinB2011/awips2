<div class="Body">To execute any Smart Tool, you must perform these
steps:</div>
<div class="Step-First">
<ol>
  <li>Set the Weather Element you wish to modify "Editable" by clicking
MB2
over
it on the Legend or MB1 in the Grid Manager.&nbsp; Note that the Edit
Action
Dialog displays only the tools which can operate on the "Editable"
Weather
Element.</li>
  <li>Select the set of grids you wish to modify by defining the
Spatial
Editor
time or the Grid Manager's selected time range as described in the
previous
section.</li>
  <li>Select the area over which you want the Smart tool to apply using
the
Select
Points tool or by executing an edit area query, both described in
previous
sections.</li>
  <li>Open the Edit Actions Dialog and Execute the desired Smart Tool
by
clicking
on the Smart Tool label with MB1. You may also execute a Smart Tool by
clicking MB3 over the Spatial Editor and selecting the desired tool.</li>
  <li>Some Smart Tools display a dialog allowing you to choose various
options
prior to running the tool. In this case, select the desired options.
You
may then choose to simply "Run" the tool (in which case the dialog will
remain for further executions of the tool) or to "Run/Dismiss" (in
which
case the dialog will disappear as the tool executes).</li>
</ol>
</div>
As the Smart Tool executes, you will see its progress indicated on the
<a href="StatusBar.html#ProgressBar">Progress
Bar</a> located on the bottom right of the GFE window.
<div class="Body">&nbsp;
<br>
If you are unclear at all about Step 1 or Step 2, we strongly recommend
that you review those sections of this document. It is very important
that
you understand how to identify the specific grids and the area you wish
to modify before executing any Smart Tool. Without this understanding
it
is very easy to modify grids in ways you do not intend.</div>

The following exercises take you through the execution of Smart Tools
in the context of two forecasting scenarios. The exercises are
presented
in a visual format that shows how the Background weather situation, the
GFE simple tools and the GFE Smart Tools interact within the Scenario.
These exercises give you the "Big Picture" for using the GFE in a
Forecast
situation and bring much of what you have learned to culmination. They
are meant to stimulate your thinking about how Smart Tools can be used
at your particular site. The exercises are challenging as all steps are
not detailed. Feel free to refer back to previous sections if necessary
to perform an instruction.</div>
<h2 class="2Heading">
<a name="Convective"></a>Convective Scenario</h2>
<div class="Body">The following diagram shows the forecast situation
which
is addressed in the Convective Scenario.&nbsp;&nbsp; If the
"Convective_SmartTool"&nbsp;
does not appear in the list of Edit Actions, follow the instructions in
the section <a href="#Exist">Creating a Smart Tool from an Existing
File</a>
to install it from the examples/smartTools directory of your release.
<p>Follow the instructions below to see how Smart Tools might be
applied
in this kind of situation.

<div class="Body">The following Scenario is meant for areas with
diverse
terrain, but will serve as an illustration of the power and flexibility
of Smart Tools and perhaps give ideas for other forecast situations.
Follow
the instructions in the Scenario.</div>
