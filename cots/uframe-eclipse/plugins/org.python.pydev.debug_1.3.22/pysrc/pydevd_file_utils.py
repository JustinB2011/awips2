'''
    This module provides utilities to get the absolute filenames so that we can be sure that:
        - The case of a file will match the actual file in the filesystem (otherwise breakpoints won't be hit).
        - Providing means for the user to make path conversions when doing a remote debugging session in
          one machine and debugging in another.
    
    To do that, the PATHS_FROM_CLIENT_TO_SERVER constant must be filled with the appropriate paths.
    
    E.g.: 
        If the server has the structure
            /user/projects/my_project/src/package/module1.py  
        
        and the client has: 
            c:\my_project\src\package\module1.py  
            
        the PATHS_FROM_CLIENT_TO_SERVER would have to be:
            PATHS_FROM_CLIENT_TO_SERVER = [(r'c:\my_project\src', r'/user/projects/my_project/src')]
    
    @note: DEBUG_CLIENT_SERVER_TRANSLATION can be set to True to debug the result of those translations
    
    @note: the case of the paths is important! Note that this can be tricky to get right when one machine
    uses a case-independent filesystem and the other uses a case-dependent filesystem (if the system being
    debugged is case-independent, 'normcase()' should be used on the paths defined in PATHS_FROM_CLIENT_TO_SERVER). 
    
    @note: all the paths with breakpoints must be translated (otherwise they won't be found in the server)
    
    @note: to enable remote debugging in the target machine (pydev extensions in the eclipse installation)
        import pydevd;pydevd.settrace(host, stdoutToServer, stderrToServer, port, suspend)
        
        see parameter docs on pydevd.py
        
    @note: for doing a remote debugging session, all the pydevd_ files must be on the server accessible 
        through the PYTHONPATH (and the PATHS_FROM_CLIENT_TO_SERVER only needs to be set on the target 
        machine for the paths that'll actually have breakpoints).
