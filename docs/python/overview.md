# Python API

The **python-awips** package provides a data access framework (DAF) for requesting grid and geometry datasets from an EDEX server.  The DAF can be used to interact in command line, or scripting form, with the EDEX.  This is an alternative to using CAVE to interact with the data.

Thorough documentation for python-awips can be found [**here**](http://unidata.github.io/python-awips/).
