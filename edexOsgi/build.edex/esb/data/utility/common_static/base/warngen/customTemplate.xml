  <!-- areaConfig: specifies how the area portion of the warning is generated; Mainly used
 	for determining the impacting counties in the 1st bullet
    	- inclusionPercent: If an area greater than this percentage of area is covered, include it in the warning
    	- inclusionArea: If an area greater than this is covered, include it in the warning (Square Kilometers)
	- inclusionAndOr: AND - both inclusionPercent and inclusionArea must pass in
		order to be included. OR - either inclusionPercent or inclusionArea
		can pass pass to be included.
        	- pointField: the column name in the pointSource that contains the name of the point
        	- sortBy: Can sort by 'name','parent','size',
	- pointFilter: Controls which point (i.e. cities) to include in the 1st bullet based on 
        		the 'WARNGENLEV' of the point. WARNGENLEV is a value from 1 to 3.
        		key: WARNGENLEV (Column name in the pointSource)
        		value: 1,2,or 3 (Can only be a single value), 0 does nothing
        		type: INCLUSIVE - include only points that match the value
        		      EXCLUSIVE - exclude only points that match the value
        		      For example: INCLUSIVE 1,will only include points that are WARNGENLEV 1,
        		      	         EXCLUSIVE 3, will only include points that are WARNGENLEV 1 and 2
  	- fipsField: the name of the attribute that retrieves the fips

	- areaNotationField: The column in the areaSource table that contains the key 
        		used to map to the correct areaNotation. Look at countTypes.txt
	- areaNotationTranslationFile: TranslationFile to look up an area 
          	notation located in /edex/data/utility/common_static/base/warngen
	- includedWatchAreaBuffer: The number of MILES the warning polygon will be increased to include nearby watches

	- otherPoints: this configures the otherPoints object for the fourth bullet. It
		uses the same pointSource as the areaConfig
		- includeAreaPoints: true/false, don't add name if already available for 1st bullet
		- includeClosePoints: true/false, don't add name if already available for 3rd bullet
		- sortBy - Can sort the path cast by 'distance', 'name', 'population','warngenlev','lat','lon',
