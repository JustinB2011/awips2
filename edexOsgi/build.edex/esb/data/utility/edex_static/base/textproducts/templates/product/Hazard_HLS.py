    ### NOTES

    ##     HANDLING HLS SEGMENTATION
    ##
    ##     Problem:
    ##     The system is set up to sample hazards using the combinations file
    ##     edit areas i.e. do not sample zones not in the combinations
    ##     segmenting strictly according to the hazards i.e. all zones
    ##     in a combination  with the same hazard will be in a
    ##     segment.
    ##
    ##     The HLS formatter uses the combinations file differently.
    ##     Segmenting is  initially done according to the hazards as
    ##     above, but  IF a forecaster wants to further split the
    ##     segment, he/she  can set up a combination in the zone
    ##     combiner to do so.   This however, is optional and all
    ##     areas (land and marine)  in the WFO need to be sampled for
    ##     hazards regardless of  what's in the combinations file.
    ##
    ##     Solution:
    ##     The HLS code has several relatively independent pieces, and
    ##     each has to  sample the hazards correctly:
    ##
    ##     --GUI code:  Sampled by "_determineSegments" and stored in
    ##     argDict['hazards']
    ##
    ##     --Formatter Logic code:  Sampled by "_getProductInfo" and
    ##     stored in argDict['hazards'].    Note: we can't re-use the
    ##     hazards set by the GUI code  because between the time the
    ##     GUI is called and the formatter  code is invoked, the
    ##     TextFormatter infrastructure has  re-sampled the hazards
    ##     using the combinations file as  above and reset the
    ##     argDict['hazards']  entry.
    ##
    ##     --Override DiscretePhrases "getHazardList" to use the hazards
    ##     stored in argDict  rather than using the one automatically
    ##     generated by TextFormatter  infrastructure which uses the
    ##     combinations file as above.

- CHECK FUEL LEVELS ON AUTOMOBILES...GENERATORS...AND CHAIN SAWS.
- IF YOU NEED TO MAKE A TRIP TO THE HARDWARE STORE...THE GROCERY

- DETERMINE WHERE YOU SHOULD SEEK SHELTER IF THE STORM APPROACHES

- CONSIDER WHETHER YOU LIVE IN A POTENTIAL EVACUATION ZONE. IF
