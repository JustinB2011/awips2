<!--
   This file defines grouping and replacement text for marine zones in the watch
   wording of the template.

   For each entry, the "match" attribute defines a regular expression that is
   used to match marine zone UGCs.  The "replace" attribute defines the text to
   pass to the template.  If the replacement text is empty, the marine zone
   will not be used.  If the "replace" attribute is not present, the marine
   zone's original name is used.

   Marine zone UGCs are matched against entries in their given order; the first
   match is used.  The order of the entries also determines the order of the
   values passed to the template.
