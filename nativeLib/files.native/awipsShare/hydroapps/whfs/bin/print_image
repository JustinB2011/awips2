# Russ Erb / Bryon Lawrence June 5, 2002   Modified to provide ability
#                                          to print color images on 
#                                          from a HP workstation.
#
# Purpose:
#
#    This script will capture an image on the screen and print it.
#    It was designed to be called from a program such as timeseries
#    or hydromap which provide the option of capturing an image
#    on the screen and sending it to a printer.
#
#    The commands that must be called to do this are different on the
#    HP/UX and Linux operating systems.  So this script has the logic
#    built into it to determine which operating system it is being run
#    on.
#
#    The caller of this script must provide three arguments: the name of the
#    window to be "captured" and printed, the print command followed
#    by any print options, and a flag indicating whether or not to print
#    the image in reverse color ( 0 = print normal, and 1 = print reverse ).
