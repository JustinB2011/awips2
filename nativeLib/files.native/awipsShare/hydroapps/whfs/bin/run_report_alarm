# a product and send them to the text database

# This script has been made obsolete by a new java-based service that
# runs within the EDEX ingest JVM named
# com.raytheon.uf.edex.ohd.reportalarm.RunReportAlarmSrv.
#
# This new service can still be configured using a site-level override
# to the standard Apps_defaults file.
#
# Configuration options for that file are defined within the base file.
#
# Logging for the run_report_alarm process has been moved to 
# /awips2/edex/logs/edex-ingest-ohd-YYYYMMDD.log.
#
# For more information on this change please refer to A2 redmine 
# DR #2783.
