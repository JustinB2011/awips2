# run_rpf_batch
# April, 2005
#
#
# Sample file for running the non-interactive version of RiverPro.
# This file should be configured to your local office needs.
#
# To run the rpf_batch program, its three arguments need to be defined.
#
#   -d dbname     = Required name of the IHFS Informix database.
#
#   -p pccfile    = Required name of the product content control (pcc) 
#                   file that contains the high-level instructions for
#                   generating the product. The pcc filename should include
#                   the suffix identifying the office
#                   name such as fls_def.pcc.XXX with the full path name
#   -s filesuffix = Optional name of the suffix to be appended onto the
#                   output product and log files created by the program.
#                   If not specified, the process id will be used.
#                   Use of the file suffix is strongly suggested to facilitate
#                   the dissemination of the generated product by allowing
#                   its filename to be known.
#   
#  Note: The product only inlcude the information for
#  points specified after keyword "INCLUDE_POINTS:" in
#  the pcc file
#  
# After creating the product, the product can be issued to the
# appropriate communications circuits using the rpf_issue script.
# 
# Define some environment variables, including the log directories
# and the database name.

#                    change the generated product name from rpf_product.$SUFFIX
#                    to work_product.$SUFFIX
