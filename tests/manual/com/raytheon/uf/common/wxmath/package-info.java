// TODO
// FIXME: Because this common plugin is only part of a viz feature at the
// moment, it does not work with the current auto-test framework, which only
// tests EDEX plugins and plugins referenced by EDEX features. If either this
// plugin becomes part of an EDEX feature or the auto test framework is able to
// test viz code, this package should be moved to /tests/unit/.
